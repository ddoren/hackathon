# hackathon
>Basically scrap the pdfs from epddanmark, extract the required data (PWD parameter for each material) and make this data more accessible 

>This data can then be used to calculate the env impact of each material easier and thus of therefore of the whole building, it however should be regularly updated.

>Can also be used by a plugin for the construction/architecture software (Something that was 'kinda' implemented in the hackaton)
